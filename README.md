## Description
a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

> This application brought together the use of switch cases and sql queries to retrieve information from a table as well as add new information to it and edit it as well. I tried several different approaches throughout the development, but eventually settled on keeping it as simple as possible using functions, variables, and queries. 

## Instruction 
> In order to use this application you will have to download the repository, or clone it, and open it up in your chosen terminal (Vs.Code, GitBash, Terminal for Mac, etc.). It will require that you have mySQL installed and have access to a user account with access to databases. Then you will have to ensure that node package manager has been installed (using "npm install" in the terminal) and you'll need to install Inquirer as well, (by typing "npm install inquirer" into your terminal). you will also need to install console.table(npm install console.table --save) to properly display the information. Most importantly you will need to change the username and password in the ```const connection``` to whatever your username and password for your mySQL is. Before running the application, you can run ```source db/db.sql```, ```source db/schema.sql```, and ```source db/seeds.sql``` in your mySQL terminal to populate a database to use. You can then run the application by typing "node index". The video attached at the top shows what will occur.
